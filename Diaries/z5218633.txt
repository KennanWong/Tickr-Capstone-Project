Week 1
===
I met the other group members, discussed potential projects and decided on the event management option. 
I was assigned mainly backend. I researched Java backend frameworks for potential usage.

Week 2
===
We decided together on the libraries and frameworks we are going to use. I started designing and implementing
the backend architecture.

Week 3
===
I finished implementing the backend architecture and worked on the tasks required for Sprint 1, mainly 
user registration and login as well as event page viewing and integrating the email APIs.

Week 4
===
We demoed our Sprint 1 for our tutor. We had a retrospective meeting, and decided on things to
improve on. I started researching the Stripe card handling API.

Week 5
===
I mainly worked on implemented ticket purchasing flow, including integration with the Stripe API.

Week 6
===
My team decided to change the interface for ticket purchasing, so I updated my implementation of ticket
purchasing to match. Additionally, I started work on additional search options.

Week 7
===
This week, I finished work on search options, as well as implementing review and reply creation. Additionally,
I implemented announcements and helped implement ticket viewing, as well as implementing deletion for all entities
in the system. I also implemented a dummy data system for quickly providing data for the demos.

Week 8
===
We had our Sprint 2 demo this week. It went fairly well, though some mistakes were made in the demo which caused us to needlessly lose marks. We had
our retro as well, where we decided to focus on integration testing, starting earlier and communicating. We also designed the API for the next sprint.
In terms of code, I mainly spent the week researching recommendations systems and starting to implement geocoding support

Week 9
===
This week, I finished geocoding support as well as implementing the recommendation system and ticket refunding. I also augmented the dummy data system.

Week 10
===
We had our final demo this week, which went fairly well. I spent the rest of the week working on refactoring and cleaning up code, as well as working
on the report
